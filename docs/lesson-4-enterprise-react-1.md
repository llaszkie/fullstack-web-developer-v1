# Lesson 4: Enterprise React Architecture - Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern & Secure Authentication

## Overview

This lesson focuses on using Next.js as a Backend for Frontend (BFF) to provide APIs and implement authentication in enterprise-grade React applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the BFF (Backend for Frontend) pattern
- Implement robust API routes in Next.js
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Manage user sessions securely
- Protect routes and API endpoints

## Key Concepts

### Next.js as a BFF

- Understanding the BFF architecture
- Benefits of using Next.js as a BFF
- API route organization and structure
- Error handling and validation

### API Development

- RESTful API design principles
- Request validation with zod or joi
- Response formatting and status codes
- API versioning strategies
- Rate limiting and security headers

### Authentication

- Authentication strategies (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Implementing NextAuth.js
- Social login integration
- Custom credential providers
- Secure cookie handling

### Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission-based authorization
- Protecting API routes
- Protecting page routes with middleware
- Client-side authorization

### Session Management

- Server-side session handling
- Client-side session state
- Session persistence
- Secure logout mechanisms

## Exercises

1. Create a Next.js BFF with CRUD operations
2. Implement JWT authentication with NextAuth.js
3. Add social login (Google, GitHub)
4. Implement role-based route protection
