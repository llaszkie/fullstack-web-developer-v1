- [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/)

## Environment Setup

### Node.js Setup with nvm

First, we'll set up [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage our [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installation. Using nvm makes it easy to switch between different Node.js versions as needed.

1. Visit the [nvm installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for the latest installation command. You can install nvm by running the install script:

```bash
# The curl command below will always fetch the latest version
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

2. After installation, restart your terminal or run:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
```

3. Install and use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js:

```bash
nvm install --lts      # Installs the latest LTS version
nvm use --lts         # Uses the installed LTS version
```

4. Verify your installation:

```bash
node --version        # Should show the LTS version number
npm --version         # Should show the npm version that comes with Node.js
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: You can list all available Node.js versions with `nvm ls-remote` and install a specific version with `nvm install <version>`. For this course, any recent LTS version (20.x or newer) will work fine.

### Development Environment

Recommended VS Code extensions:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- GitLens

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: TypeScript Warm-up

Create a simple TypeScript application that:

- Defines interfaces for a User and a Post
- Implements some functions that use these interfaces
- Uses generics to create a type-safe data container
- Implements async operations with proper error handling

### Exercise 2: Modern JavaScript Features

Write code examples demonstrating:

- Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Destructuring
- Spread/rest operators
- Optional chaining
- Nullish coalescing

### Exercise 3: Git Practice

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Clone it locally
3. Create a feature branch
4. Make changes and commit them
5. Create a pull request
6. Resolve an intentionally created merge conflict

## Self-Assessment
