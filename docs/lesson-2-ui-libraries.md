# Lesson 2: Building Modern UIs with Component Libraries

## Overview

This bridge lesson focuses on using modern UI component libraries to build professional, accessible, and consistent user interfaces. You'll learn how to integrate, customize, and effectively use component libraries in your Vite applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand component library ecosystems and patterns
- Master component composition and customization
- Implement accessible UI patterns
- Create consistent theming systems
- Build reusable component abstractions

## Key Concepts

### Component Library Fundamentals

- Understanding component architecture
- Styling strategies (CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, CSS Modules)
- Theme customization
- Accessibility patterns
- Component composition patterns

### Modern UI Libraries

- Shadcn/UI: Building blocks approach
- Radix UI: Headless components
- Material UI: Full-featured system
- Component API design patterns
- State management integration

### Design Systems

- Creating consistent visual language
- Building component variants
- Theme tokens and variables
- Dark mode implementation
- Responsive design patterns

### Advanced Patterns

- Compound components
- Render props and HOCs
- Polymorphic components
- Component state machines
- Reusable hooks patterns
