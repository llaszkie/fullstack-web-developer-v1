# Lesson 5: Global-Ready Applications - Internationalization, Progressive Web Apps & Containerized Deployment

## Overview

This lesson covers advanced enterprise features including internationalization, Progressive Web App capabilities, and containerized deployment with Docker.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement internationalization (i18n) in Next.js applications
- Convert a Next.js app into a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Containerize a Next.js application with Docker
- Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

## Key Concepts

### Internationalization (i18n)

- Setting up next-i18next
- Managing translation files
- Language detection and switching
- Right-to-left (RTL) support
- Date, number, and currency formatting

### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

- PWA principles and benefits
- Service worker implementation
- Offline capabilities
- App manifest configuration
- Push notifications
- Installation prompts

### Docker Deployment

- Docker fundamentals for frontend applications
- Creating optimized Dockerfiles for Next.js
- Multi-stage builds
- Environment variables in Docker
- Docker Compose for local development

### CI/CD Integration

- Setting up GitHub Actions
- Automated testing in CI
- Build and deployment pipelines
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secrets management

## Exercises

1. Add multi-language support to a Next.js application
2. Convert a Next.js app to a PWA with offline support
3. Create a production-ready Dockerfile for a Next.js application
4. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
