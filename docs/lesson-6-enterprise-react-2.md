- Date, number, and currency formatting

### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

- PWA principles and benefits
- Service worker implementation
- Offline capabilities
- App manifest configuration
- Push notifications
- Installation prompts

### Docker Deployment

- Docker fundamentals for frontend applications
- Creating optimized Dockerfiles for Next.js
- Multi-stage builds
- Environment variables in Docker
- Docker Compose for local development

### CI/CD Integration

- Setting up GitHub Actions
- Automated testing in CI
- Build and deployment pipelines
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secrets management

## Exercises

Follow these tutorials in order to implement global-ready features in your Next.js application:

1. Build a Multi-language Next.js Application
   Follow these tutorials in sequence:

   - [Built-in i18n Routing in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)
   - [Complete Application with next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router)

   Implementation steps:

   - Set up basic i18n routing with Next.js
   - Integrate next-intl for message handling
   - Create type-safe translations
   - Implement automatic language detection
   - Handle date, number, and currency formatting
   - Build a language switcher with locale persistence
   - Set up SEO-friendly metadata for each language

2. Progressive Web App with Next.js
   Follow these resources in sequence:

   - [Official Next.js PWA Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/progressive-web-apps)
   - [Building a PWA with Next.js (Video Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ipasAxK5H8)

   Implementation steps:

   - Configure next-pwa for your application
   - Add offline support with service workers
   - Create app manifest and icons
   - Implement push notifications
   - Test PWA functionality and installation
   - Add offline fallback pages
   - Configure background sync

3. [Dockerizing Next.js Applications](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker)

   - Create an optimized Dockerfile for Next.js
   - Configure multi-stage builds for production
   - Set up Docker Compose for development
   - Handle environment variables securely
   - Implement cache optimization strategies

4. [GitHub Actions for Next.js](https://staticmania.com/blog/how-to-deploy-next-js-application-with-github-action)
   - Set up automated testing workflow
   - Configure build and deployment pipeline
   - Manage environment secrets
   - Add pull request previews
   - Implement continuous deployment

The combination of these tutorials will give you hands-on experience with:

- Building globally accessible applications
- Implementing offline-first capabilities
- Creating production-ready containers
- Setting up automated deployment pipelines
