# Lesson 6: Quality Engineering - Comprehensive Testing, Security Compliance & Performance Optimization

## Overview

This lesson focuses on modern quality engineering practices for Next.js applications, covering comprehensive testing methodologies with Vitest, security compliance based on OWASP guidelines, and performance optimization techniques to achieve optimal Core Web Vitals scores.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement comprehensive testing strategies using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Master unit, integration, and component testing for React applications
- Set up end-to-end testing with Playwright for critical user journeys
- Apply OWASP security principles to protect against common vulnerabilities
- Optimize application performance to achieve excellent Core Web Vitals scores

## Key Concepts

### Modern Testing Fundamentals

- Testing pyramid vs. testing trophy approaches
- Test-driven development (TDD) workflow
- Behavior-driven development (BDD) with Gherkin syntax
- Testing best practices for React and Next.js applications
- Code coverage analysis and quality gates

### Unit Testing with Vitest

- Vitest configuration and integration with Next.js
- Testing React components with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Mocking dependencies, APIs, and modules
- Testing hooks and custom logic with @testing-library/react-hooks
- Component snapshot testing and UI verification

### Integration Testing

- Testing component interactions and user flows
- API integration tests with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Database integration testing strategies
- Component composition testing with React Testing Library
- Test environment setup and teardown

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

- Playwright setup and configuration with Next.js
- Writing E2E test scenarios for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing and screenshot comparisons
- Cross-browser and cross-device testing strategies
- CI/CD integration and automated test reporting

### Security Testing and OWASP Compliance

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities identification and mitigation
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention techniques
- CSRF protection implementation
- Input validation, sanitization, and output encoding
- Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
- Authentication and authorization security testing

### Performance Optimization

- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Lighthouse audits and performance scoring
- Bundle size analysis and code splitting
- Image and asset optimization techniques
- Memory leak detection and profiling
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) implementation

## Exercises

1. Set up a comprehensive testing suite with Vitest, React Testing Library, and MSW
2. Create and run end-to-end tests with Playwright for critical user journeys
3. Conduct a security audit based on OWASP Top 10 and implement necessary protections
4. Analyze and optimize application performance using Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals
