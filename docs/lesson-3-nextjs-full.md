# Lesson 3: Advanced Next.js - Building a Full-Stack Dashboard Application

## Overview

This lesson guides you through building a full-stack application using Next.js App Router and modern React features. Following the official Next.js Dashboard tutorial, you'll create a comprehensive financial dashboard while learning advanced Next.js concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Master Next.js App Router architecture and patterns
- Build a full-stack application with authentication
- Implement advanced data fetching patterns
- Create dynamic, interactive UI components
- Deploy a production-ready application

## Key Concepts

### App Router Architecture

- Understanding the App Router directory structure
- Server Components vs. Client Components
- Route groups and layouts
- Parallel routes and intercepting routes
- Loading UI and error handling
- Authentication and middleware

### Dashboard Implementation

- Project Structure and Setup

  - Setting up a new Next.js project
  - Configuring TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Database setup with Postgres
  - Authentication with NextAuth.js

- UI Components and Styling

  - Creating reusable components
  - Implementing responsive layouts
  - Styling with Tailwind CSS
  - Building dynamic forms

- Data Management
  - Server Component data fetching
  - React Server Actions for mutations
  - Search and pagination
  - Real-time updates
  - Error handling

### Advanced Features

- Authentication Flow

  - Protected routes
  - User sessions
  - Login and logout
  - Role-based access

- Database Integration

  - Setting up Postgres on Vercel
  - Database schema design
  - CRUD operations
